    "# MODEL 2: Chicago Women at-risk of Developing Breast Cancer (2017)\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second model Civis trained for our work with the Chicago Department of Public Health. This notebook goes through each step of Civis' process for predicting the population of Chicago women who are at-risk of developing breast cancer. We follow a 2-step modeling process to estimate the percentage of women in each Census tract in Chicago that are likely to be uninsured. In the first step, we'll train a model on individual-level data, where each row is a person. In the second step, we'll train a model on geographic-level data, where we use the same features as the individual-level model, but the values are aggregated by our geographic-level of interest (in this case, Census tracts). We'll then use our model to predict the proportion of uninsured women in each Census tract in Chicago.\n",
    "\n",
    "This 2-step modeling process helps us avoid a reverse ecological fallacy problem, or an exception fallacy, which is a potential problem that arises from modeling based off survey response data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conduct our analyses, we'll be using the Civis Analytics platform API to connect to our data, create tables, and query our data. Through the Civis API, we'll also be able to use CivisML, our machine learning package. We'll use this to train and test our models, as well as make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll set up our workspace. We'll be using the Civis Analytics platform API to connect to our data, create tables, and query our data. Through the Civis API, we'll also be able to use CivisML, our machine learning package. We'll use this to train and test our models, as well as make predictions.\n",

(source: https://seer.cancer.gov/archive/csr/1975_2012/results_merged/topic_lifetime_risk.pdf; table 5.17). We used the relative risk value for developing cancer in the next 10 years for each age and race group. For groups that had a relative risk of zero, we assigned them a relative risk of 0.0001 so that their overall relative risk wouldn't just be zero because their baseline risk is zero.\n",
    "6.  Coalesce Breast Cancer Risk factors into one variable (\"bc_risk\") by multiplying them together to get overall relative risk; use baseline risk as original value.\n",
    "7.  Split the breast cancer risk variable into a binary variable (\"bc_risk_2cat\"). Use 0.05 as the cut-off, as it is approximately double the median baseline risk for all races/ages.\n",
